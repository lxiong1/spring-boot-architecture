Based on a 2019 survey done by JetBrains on Java developers, Spring Boot was found to be very popular as shown by Figure ~\ref{fig:jb-survey-app-server} and ~\ref{fig:jb-survey-web-framework}.

\end{figure}

Both questions in the survey were overwhelmingly in favor of Spring Boot so can be easily written with confidence that Spring Boot is a familiar and heavily used Java framework. JetBrains adds that "Spring Boot has become the most popular Java web framework, adding 14\% since last year" \cite{jetbrains:online}.

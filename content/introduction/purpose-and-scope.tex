\section{Purpose and Scope}

Spring Boot is an extension of larger Spring Framework so it undoubtedly cannot be introduced without it. Spring Framework was created by a passionate Java developer named Rod Johnson who conceptualized the project in 2002. The idea behind the project was to create easier server-side development experience as software was becoming more and more complex to create. Developers at the time had to manually define dependencies as well as configurations which often became unwieldy.\\

Rod Johnson wanted to address these problems with Spring Framework and the Java development community were extremely receptive. As the Spring Framework grew in popularity and usage, the Spring team needed to address the problem of its' traditional approach of directly embedding Spring web applications to a servlet container. It needed to separate the concern of web application development from the core Spring Framework capabilities, and thus Spring Boot was born.\\

Spring Boot, an open-source software project, is the rapid application development (RAD)
module within the broader Spring Framework. Spring Boot is intended to provide “a radically
faster and widely accessible getting-started experience for all Spring development” [9]. Spring boot was first implemented in 2014 and continues to evolve with new features such as the Spring Boot command-line interface (CLI) and integrations with popular technologies like Maven.

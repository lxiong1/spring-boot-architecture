Out of the box, Spring Boot integrates with leading deployment technologies like Docker and Cloud Foundry so that Spring Boot applications can deploy as a single unit. Depending on the system's infrastructure, applications are typically deployed to multiple servers to manage load balancing. Spring Boot is designed to develop applications that are production-ready and easy to deploy by default \cite{springBootDeployment}. The whole appeal of Spring Boot is to make the development and deployment of Java applications easy, so the deployment viewpoint is integral to the system.

\subsection*{Reusability}

\textbf{Overview:} Developer adds new component to Spring Boot project that did not exist before by leveraging existing components. \\

\textbf{System and environment state:} Spring Boot project is downloaded and loaded in the integrated development environment. The integrated development environment is working with no errors. \\

\textbf{External stimulus:} Developer adds support for new component to enable lazy initialization globally by providing new annotation/interface. \\

\textbf{System response:} Spring Boot will be able to provide support for global lazy initialization exposed through annotation reusing existing components. \\

\textbf{Response measure:} In 95\% of all instances, Spring Boot requires less effort to write the new component by leveraging the existing component as Spring Boot follows the principal of separation of concern wisely.

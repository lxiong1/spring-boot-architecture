\subsection*{Dependency Auto-configuration}

\textbf{Overview:} How Spring Boot deciphers what to auto-configure based on dependencies in the classpath.\\

\textbf{System state:} All desired dependencies from the starter modules are declared appropriately in the chosen dependency management tool. The \texttt{Main} application class has been annotated with \texttt{@SpringBootApplication}. \\

\textbf{System environment:} Local machine is running as normally and integrated development environment is fully functional. \\

\textbf{External stimulus:} The \texttt{SpringApplication.run()} method is invoked. \\

\textbf{Required system response:} The Spring Boot application will iterate over the collection of \texttt{spring.factories} auto-configuration classes, in which it will scan dependencies declared in the classpath to find all matches. Once the dependencies have been discovered for matches, they will be auto-configured accordingly.

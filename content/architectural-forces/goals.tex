\section{Goals}

Spring Boot has the following goals:

\begin{itemize}
\item Usability -- Sprint Boot framework is developed with the intention of assisting developers auto-configure dependencies and quickly build out a web application. The framework helps developers to avoid spending time learning and understanding how to configure dependencies as compared to Spring Framework. The Spring Framework essentially forces a user to configure dependencies themselves by mechanism of specific annotation declarations with written java code, or XML configurations.
\item Efficiency -- Developers spending less time on basic configurations and writing redundant code ultimately results in increased productivity, and gives the ability to get a business product to production faster.
\item Development Resource -- The Spring Boot framework underneath the good uses the Spring Framework as its' foundation but it also brings along unique qualities and characteristics. Since the Spring ecosystem is so large and complex, this requires meticulous dedication to learn it in-and-out to contribute in a way that allows it to be maintainable, scalable, and meaningful to its' community.
\end{itemize}

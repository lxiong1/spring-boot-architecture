\section{Constraints}

Spring Boot has the following constraints:

\begin{itemize}
\item Spring Boot is written in Java and uses the \texttt{Spring Java Format} which enforces Spring-specific code formatting conventions for contributors \cite{springBootContribution}.
\item Spring Boot requires embedded servlet containers such as Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow to support the deployment of applications.
\item Spring Boot takes an opinionated view of utilizing Spring Framework to its advantage and therefore its evolution is directly tied to it.
\item Sprint Boot makes dependency management of third party libraries easier by integrating common libraries into its' module as transitive dependencies. Some of these common transitive dependencies include logging frameworks like SLF4J and Log4J, serializer and deserializer such as GSON and Jackson, and databases such as MongoDB and PostgreSQL.
\end{itemize}

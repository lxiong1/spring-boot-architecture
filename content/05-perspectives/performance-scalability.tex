\subsection*{Performance and Scalability}

\ranking High

Enhancing the performance and scalability of applications built on Spring Boot is a primary concern of its opinionated maintainers. Spring Boot integrates with Spring Cloud, which provides the following extensibility \cite{springCloud} :

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Distributed/versioned configuration
    \item Service registration and discovery
    \item Routing
    \item Service-to-service calls
    \item Load balancing
    \item Circuit Breakers
    \item Global locks
    \item Leadership election and cluster state
    \item Distributed messaging
\end{enumerate}

Applications using the Spring Boot framework are meant to be lightweight, scalable, and performant.

\subsection*{Location}

Like the \textit{Availability and Resilience} perspective, \textit{Location} is ultimately the concern of the applications that implement Spring Boot. With that said, the framework has tools to support the \textit{Location} concerns of those applications.

Spring Boot can be installed locally to develop and test an application that is deployed remotely.  Concerns related to those remote systems are typically handled by standard software management systems like AWS console and VCenter. The Spring Boot Actuator module supports efforts to monitor the health of those systems.

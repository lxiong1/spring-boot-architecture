Spring Boot is an open-source project with users worldwide and an active community of contributors. Because Spring Boot's architecture is highly extensible, it is flexible enough to evolve and integrate with new technologies. This flexibility, balanced by the stability of the application's core components, is critical to Spring Boot's continued success in the Java ecosystem.

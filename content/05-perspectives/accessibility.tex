Spring Boot is not a consumer-facing product. It is a robust framework used to develop RESTful applications and is not consumed directly by the general public. The Spring Boot project is maintained on GitHub, which is accessible to an extent \cite{github-accessibility}, but the onus here is on GitHub rather than Spring Boot.

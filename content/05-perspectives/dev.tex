Spring Boot has a learning curve, but with just a quick scan of the project's GitHub repository, it is clear that the system's development team is committed to a high standard of code quality. There are Git Hooks to verify that code staged for commit doesn't break anything, and Checkstyles to ensure consistent formatting. The contribution documentation spells out specific instructions for tracking issues and commits. With contributors from around the world, it may seem difficult to maintain the code, but the Spring Boot team has created a culture with its documentation that is enforced by automated tools, which safeguard the application from becoming unmanageable. The development perspective is important because Spring Boot's viability is dependent, in part, on contributions from volunteer developers \cite{contributingDoc}.
